Yeah I have to say you just need to run that guess.py file in cmd then the game will be run 
+ First, this file does not contain malicious code 

+Second, don't delete the Q table file, otherwise you won't be able to fight against AI 

+Next I have given you the AI file if you need it 

+IMPORTANT: you must download numpy to your computer for the game to run. It's all because of AI. Just go to terminal and type: pip install numpy. Yeah if you have python :v

+ This program is written by AI
